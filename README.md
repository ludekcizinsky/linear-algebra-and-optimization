## About

This repository was created with the aim to help students taking the course `Linear algebra and Optimization` at `IT University of Copenhagen` to:

- Prepare for the exam

- Be able to focus on discussion of the given problems with TA in the course and not to worry about copying TAs notes from the blackboard

- Give you a better visual intuition of certain abstract concepts using `Geogebra`

- Provide you with useful resources to support your learning journey

Please note that this is my own initiative and thus the provided solutions should **NOT** be considered as `part of the official course`. With that said, I promise to do my best in order to ensure correctness of the provided solutions.

Last but not the least, I would like to acknowledge that structure of this repository and its content is based on the official course which is managed by [Rasmus Ejlers MÃ¸gelberg](http://www.itu.dk/~mogel/).

## How it works

The course runs within the Fall semester, i.e., from `September` until `December`. Solutions to the exercise sessions will be released right before each respective TA session. This way, we hope that you spend enough time at least attempting to solve given problems. Below, you can find the solutions:

- Lecture 1: Systems of linear equations (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 2: Lecture 2: Matrices (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 3: The determinant (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 4: Vector spaces (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 5: Basis and dimension (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 6: Coordinates (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 7: Least squares (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 8: Eigenvectors (_has not been created_)
- Lecture 9: PageRank (_has not been created_)
- [Lecture 10: Introduction to calculus](https://deepnote.com/@ludekcizinsky/Lecture-10-Introduction-to-Calculus-sHck_3c4Tcqzgrj2i7SpWw)
- [Lecture 11: Motion along a curve](https://deepnote.com/@ludekcizinsky/Lecture-11-Motion-along-a-curve-fa0E8YWMQHqYq_YpxTNJNQ)
- [Lecture 12: Partial derivatives](https://deepnote.com/@ludekcizinsky/Lecture-12-Partial-derivatives-L_zbQhktT9KLNxrezfmZDw)
- [Lecture 13: The gradient](https://deepnote.com/@ludekcizinsky/Lecture-13-Gradient-Dy372wTwTZibtTsVA9FyQ)
- Lecture 14: Multiple integrals (_has not been created_)

Please note that after the course is finished, solutions will be made unavailable until the start of the course in the following year. In addition, you can not `duplicate` the provided solutions. (this is ensured via the Deepnote platform) I impose these restrictions in order to ensure that each new batch of students have the same conditions as well as motivation to actual solve the problems.

## How to study

Below, I summarize my way of studying for this course. It is based on my previous learning of what worked or not. I assume you have your own style therefore consider this as more of an inspiration.

### During semester

- Ideally, do the reading before the lecture - no need to understand everything. Take a few notes, but do not worry too much about it now.
- Attend lecture, again take some notes if neccessary.
- Start solving the exercises. **This is the most important part of your learning.** If you get stuck, try to formulate what you do not understand. Then write it down so you can then ask either in Study lab or your TA. Of course you can spend several hours googling, and might find the solution, however, it is way more efficient to use the help which is available to you. I should not forget that of course you can ask your classmates.
- Attend TA session. Use the opportunity to present the solved problem if possible. It will not only help you understand the given concept even in more depth, but it is also a nice practice for oral exams which you have for example already in 2nd semester.
- wrap up the weekly learning by:

  - Writing down your common mistakes
  - Things that you are still not so sure of and might want to practice more
  - Finish your notes - at this point you know what is important and what not, thus I take the notes at the very end after I have the experience of solving the problems

- If time, try to dedicate each week some amount of hours to revisit the previous lectures. The course is structured in such a way that you usually use the concepts learnt in the previous lecture in the following lecture.

### For the exam

- Start with knowing when and where you are going to take the exam and what aids are allowed, you can find it within the course description. I usually put this in my google calendar.

- You are given an exam set with solutions. To do each exam, you will need roughly between 3 - 5 hours:

  - 3 - 4 hours to finish it (Maybe more in the beginning when you start practicing)
  - 1 hour to evaluate your result

- I would personally put one exam aside, this one I would do the morning before the actual exam. The rest, I would split into doing over several days (one exam each day) - put this into your calendar. I would do them as soon as possible so you can identify:

  - What are your weak spots
  - How you are doing timewise

- After you have gone through all exams (except from the one which you put aside), I would try to practice the problems which you identified as difficult - use mandatory assignment problems, problems given in each lecture and if that is not enough, find some problems in the book. (in this order) At this phase, I think it is also beneficial to connect with your friend/study group so you can help each other.

- Finally, the day before exam, do the last exam from the exam set. After you are done, take time to relax, at this point you have done your best and there is nothing else you can do :) Good luck!

## Helpful resources

- [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/#lessons) - excellent videos, especially in order to get the visual intuition behind the concepts introduced in this course

## Why is this course important?

Both `Linear algebra` and `Optimization` are essential tools for your journey to become a well-grounded data scientist. You will use many (if not all) of the tools that you learn in this course, during subjects such as `Applied statistics` or `Machine learning`. (Speaking from my own experience as a DS student)
